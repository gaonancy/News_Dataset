Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"With so many variables and unknowns, it is not surprising that many transit projects run over original budgets and schedules.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"They typically cost at least $100 million and can often exceed $1 billion and thus are usually funded by a mix of financing that may include state/federal grants, local sales/property tax, and municipal bonds.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Transit projects are also long and linear in nature, usually traversing many kilometers of urban/suburban neighborhoods and involving a number of stakeholders including regulatory agencies, municipalities, and community organizations.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"This long, linear configuration results in right-of-way acquistion and utility relocation efforts that qualify as large projects in their own right.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Like many transit projects, Tasman West was the beneficiary of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA).",0.0

Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"On the other hand, Tasman East, Capitol, Vasona and the vehicle procurement project took a different path since they were primarily locally funded.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Locally funded projects require a citizenry that believes in the projects and trusts the owner agency enough to tax themselves to make the projects happen.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"While VTA's construction contractors typically relocate storm drain and sewer lines, the utility companies that own gas, electric, water and communications lines usually insist on relocating their own facilities.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,The window for performing relocation work is a relatively short time frame between rightof-way acquisition and the start of civil construction.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Late completion of utility relocations can have impacts that ripple through the civil, stations, and systems construction phases causing loss of productivity, crowding, and ultimately higher costs and delays.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,The light rail projects in our case study experienced large increases in utility relocation costs over the baseline budget.,1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Tasman West utility overruns were primarily due to sewer and storm drain conflicts that resulted in schedule recovery costs.,1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"The unexpected Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the 1OO year old Pacific Gas and Electric Company resulting from the California Energy Crisis in 2001 was a major contributor to the Tasman East and Capitol construction overruns, as was a higher than expected water line relocation cost.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"The Vasona overrun was primarily due to the budgeting assumption that, since much of the project runs in a dedicated rail corridor, utility relocation costs would be minimal.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"In fact, while not many utilities ran parallel to the corridor, utilities that intersected the corridor at street crossings required relocation at a substantial cost.",0.0

Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION-Perhaps the most unique aspect of transit projects is the large right-of-way acquisition effort typically required.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Schedule risk in the right-of-way acquisition process arises from the need for proper execution on a large number of parcels simultaneously.,1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"In order to avoid delays to the start of construetion, VTA developed detailed right-of-way acquisition plans that modeled the typical activities for one parcel and repeated this network for each parcel to be acquired.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"The resulting schedule, organized by construction package, contained several thousand activities, and was updated regularly until VTA obtained legal possession or right of entry of all required parcels.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"On the four projects studied, VTA never had to delay the start of a construction package due to late right-of-way acquisition.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Much of the cost risk inherent in the right-of-way acquisition process can be mitigated through the use of accurate unit prices when setting budgets.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Of special significance for transit projects is the state agency that regulates the safety of operating rail lines - in California it is the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,The CPUC approves all street crossings and certifies that rail lines are safe prior to starting service.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Special attention must be paid to track crossing applications submitted to the CPUC because, if rejected, they have the potential to significantly delay work and add millions of dollars in costs.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,This is exactly what occurred on the Vasona project.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"The rejection of a single at-grade street crossing on that project ultimately led to an 18-month delay and $10.8 million in extra design and construction costs, as an elevated, gradeseparated crossing was ultimately required.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"On the Tasman West project, VTA spent $2 million adding a pedestrian tunnel under the tracks and a massive barrier gate across an expressway as the result of unfavorable CPUC rulings late in the design process.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Project managers should also take the process of safety certification seriously as it too has the potential to delay project opening.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Due to their long, linear nature, transit projects directly impact many more residents, businesses, and municipalities than most other types of projects.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,It is critical to project success that affected parties are brought into the project delivery process.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Cities traversed by the project typically review the design, inspect construction of elements (such as traffic signals and street lights) that will become city property, and take ownership of some right-ofway parcels acquired to build the project.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Staffing constraints at the cities can impose delays in all of these areas, and cities can be a major source of scope creep during the design and construction process.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"As a proactive measure to avoid these pitfalls, project managers may consider paying the cities for dedicated review and inspection staff, co-located with project design and construction management staff, and should implement a strong change control board with the power to resist the cities' demands for enhancements.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"A strong community outreach effort opens lines of communications with affected residents, businesses, and the general public.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"The top risk factors, in order of cost impact, were: Construction * utility relocation costs; * unforeseen conditions; * unfavorable regulatory decisions; * design and management services; AND * real estate ecquistion.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Table 3 shows how these risks played out on the four projects in our case study.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"By far, the largest drivers of cost increases were utility relocation costs and unforeseen conditions.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"We have discussed utility relocation costs in some detail, but have not delved into unforeseen conditions - a risk factor on any construction project.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"In our experience on the projects in the case study, these conditions took the form of a high groundwater table, the discovery of contaminated soil and groundwater, and one of the wettest rainy seasons on record during a time of major earthwork operations.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Rounding out the list of risk factors are unfavorable regulatory decisions and real estate acquisition, which we have covered, and design and management services.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"In our experience, design and management costs grew in proportion to construction cost growth due to additional construction oversight and coordination time required to manage the greater work effort and to process the resulting volume of design and contract changes.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,The projects in our case study were quite successful.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"They were all delivered on or ahead of schedule, with only a 4.2% bottom-line increase over the baseline budget.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"However, with the full benefit of 20/20 hindsight, these projects would have been more successful if sufficient contingency had been included in the baseline budgets to mitigate the risk factors we have discussed.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Table 4 shows growth, from baseline, of all project areas except contingency.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Another way to address the risk factors we have discussed is to keep project contingency at a lower level, say 5%, and to allocate higher contingency allowances to the categories with the most risk.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"If this approach is a chosen, project managers should look closely at the areas of utility relocation, unforeseen conditions and regulatory risk factors.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"Also, remember to include design and management allocated contingency in proportion to construction contingency to account for cost growth resulting from the need to manage the greater work effort arising from construction increases.",0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"In summary, besides the typical risks present in capital improvement projects, transit projects present a unique combination of challenges arising from their large size, extensive utility relocation effort, massive right-of-way acquisition phase, and considerable scrutiny by agencies, municipalities, and the public.",1.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,Good project management practices and tools can overcome these challenges.,0.0
Management Challenges Unique to Transit Projects,12/16/2005,"With an understanding of the unique aspects of transit projects, project managers can seek to mitigate risks where possible, and to build sufficient contingency into baseline budgets to offset those that remain.",0.0
